*A subscription-based Facebook messenger bot hosted on Heroku featuring a database of products populated by a web monitor. Key design differences from other messenger bots include efficient database queries, asynchronous background services, and a responsive chat-based user interface.*

I co-created this project in a mix of panic, excitement, and the slow creeping feeling of unemployment. I spent a couple months doing Leetcode questions with my friend on Google Hangouts while working as a test technician during the day and wanted something to show for all the practice I was doing. Functionality was finished within a week and a half, but integration and actual deployment didn't happen until two months later. My friend and I decided to start this bad boy when we saw techwear company [acronym](https://acrnm.com/) raising prices to 200% of their initial offerings. The project is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/); it runs through continuous integration and a development app before fully deploying changes and creating a release. 


The messenger API would time out more often than we thought. Persistent menus also weren't fully working most of the time during development because the refresh rate for them caused a bit of trouble. Gunicorn servers (dynos) also shut down without constant access from users, putting strain on investing fifteen bucks a month to run the app.


There are many future improvements we want to make, including shifting our messenger API to [fbchat](https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat), a more updated version of [fbmq](https://github.com/conbus/fbmq). We were also thinking about shifting towards more of a hands on server instead of Heroku; something like DigitalOcean or Dreamhost. We'll see how it goes...
