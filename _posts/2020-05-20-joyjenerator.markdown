This little bot was an exercise in modern tech using Discord's API inspired by [this gentleman](https://bash.im/quote/436725) from [here](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts).

Yeah... I don't have a coffee machine on the network, I don't have a co-worker named Kumar, and I don't have a wife... but I do miss my dog when I'm at work.

Built using Python, Discord's API, and Heroku.

Take a look at the project if you want:
