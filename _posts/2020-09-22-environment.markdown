*Set of environment scripts for future reference.*

Unfortunately for tree huggers, this isn't one of those posts. Sorry.

I have a couple scripts to recreate a development enviroment I'm comfortable with.

Dev environment are always a huge hassle when migrating from computer to computer, so keeping organized alleviates the onboarding process.

As the saying goes: if I had 3 hours to chop a tree, I would spend 2 hours sharpening my axe. Sorry again tree huggers.

This is what my directory tree of my Windows environment looks like:
```
C:
└───git
    │
    └───folder1
    │      │   README.md
    │      │   file012.txt
    │      │
    │      └───subfolder1
    │          │   file111.txt
    │          │   file112.txt
    │          │   ...
    │
    └───folder2
           │   README.md
           │   file022.txt
    │
    │   ...
...

This is what my directory tree of my Unix/Mac environment looks like:
```
Users
└───$User
    └───git
        │
        └───folder1
        │      │   README.md
        │      │   file012.txt
        │      │
        │      └───subfolder1
        │          │   file111.txt
        │          │   file112.txt
        │          │   ...
        │
        └───folder2
            │   README.md
            │   file022.txt
        │
        │   ...
    ...
