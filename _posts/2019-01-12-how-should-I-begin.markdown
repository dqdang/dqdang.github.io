title: How Should I Begin
category: posts
---

I want to embark on a journey of blogging. Whatever I find interesting I'll make a note here and share my thoughts on it. I just posted a couple projects I've done in the past. They aren't as documented as I wanted them to be, so they're my reference points on projects moving forward. As time goes on, a journal of projects and weird rants will start to take up the white space. Not sure how long it'll last, but let's see where it'll bring us.
