*A Facebook messenger bot hosted on Heroku with Flask featuring a quick and easy way to get a random location for a meal. Key design differences from other messenger bots include quick and efficient Yelp API calls, asynchronous background services, and a responsive chat-based user interface.*

How many times have you gotten upset at not being able to find food while chatting with your friend on messenger? For me, more than I would like to admit.

Having a bit of experience with the HPP stack now (Heroku, Python, PostgresSQL), I decided to add in another API in conjunction with Facebook's Messenger API:
Yelp. It didn't take too long, and it's usable for now.

Take a look at the project if you want:
