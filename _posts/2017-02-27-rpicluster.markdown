*This is a user-friendly implementation of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) Clusters. A rpicluster easily integrates a real cluster of computers, removing the hassle of networking and remote procedure calls. The images come with a set of tools to aid setup, configuration, and updates. The scalable architecture allows anyone to effortlessly put together a cluster and start creating their very own distributed/parallel projects. Visit this [link](www.rpicluster.com) to download the images and for more details.*

Instead of a tasty internship, I invested my youth into a grand project for the summer. The goal was relatively simple: create a Raspberry Pi Cluster that is easily distribuated. Many hurdles were conquered and many tears were shed in the making of this. We demoed the projet multiple times at events and even won one, creating a false illusion of hope. I wanted to create a startup involving this cluster. What if we made a package that just did all the configuration? What if we extend this onto other IoT devices? We could set the standard for that. But we also forgot that we were unemployed with empty pockets.
