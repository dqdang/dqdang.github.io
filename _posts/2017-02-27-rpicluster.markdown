This is a user-friendly implementation of Raspberry Pi Clusters. A rpicluster easily integrates a real cluster of computers, removing the hassle of networking and remote procedure calls. The images come with a set of tools to aid setup, configuration, and updates. The scalable architecture allows anyone to effortlessly put together a cluster and start creating their very own distributed/parallel projects. Visit this [link](www.rpicluster.com) to download the images and for more details.
