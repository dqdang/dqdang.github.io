Twitch clips are always a pain to watch. They're slow to load (especially on mobile), buffer way too often, and scrubbing in any direction makes the previous two issues worse. I can't seem to watch a 30 second video unless I wait upwards of 5 minutes while sipping my already cold coffee and eating my stale sandwich on my lunch break reading reddit.

So I decided I've had enough and created a bot to scrape a subreddit and comment YouTube mirrors for me. My specific instance is hosted on [this channel][channel].

I've written detailed instructions on how to get the bot up and running on the README for anyone wanting to host it.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of restrictions with rate limiting for uploading videos to YouTube; and understandably so.

Future alternatives include uploading to Streamable (API doesn't allow it currently) or playing a pure MP4 download from a natively hosted app. Any ideas, let me know.

Take a look at the project if you want:
