*Puzzle and Dragons experience/stamina lookup tool*

Yeah I got upset one day that PAD still doesn't easily list the experience for dungeons and [puzzledragonx.com][puzzledragonx.com] doesn't list stamina unless I dig for it. 

Quick and dirty tool to find the most efficient experience per stamina dungeon based on input experience. Updates using [puzzledragonx.com][puzzledragonx.com]. Uses a small Postgres database built on a Django server.

**Edit 01/24/2022**
[puzzledragonx.com][puzzledragonx.com] no longer exists.

Take a look at the project if you want:
