*A casual randomized exploration journey.*

I take interest in learning about the thoughts of those more religious than mine.
[Terry Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis) fascinated me with his [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS), 
and I came to the conclusion that I also wanted to explore such a route. Will update with more stuff.

EDIT:
Update on this project: I added a grayscale camera mirror.

Take a look at the project if you want:
