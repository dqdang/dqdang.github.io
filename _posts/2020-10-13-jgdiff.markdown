*League of Legends jungle path tracker*

The flavor of the month of October is competition, for League of Legends that is. My friends and I participated in a tournament hosted at the same time the world championship is. During this time, we came up with strategies, team compositions, and overall teamwork to improve our chances of winning. A common theme to winning a game for the current meta is setting up our jungler for success and snowballing the game. A key advantage in winning the jungle is knowing the path of the enemy jungler as evert jungler has their own path and can be played around.

The idea for the project is what if you ere able to look up a player and see their jungle paths?

Well, that was a cool idea until it wasn't. Riot's API spaces out the frames captured per game as 30 second intervals. When a 5 second lead is a considerable lead in the jungle, 30 seconds is too much to account for in a path. There was no way to determine the path even given the frames, gold, and experience because of external factors like invades, kills, and taxes.

Even though we failed in this project, we ended 3rd place, which exceeded expectations.

Take a look at the project if you want:
