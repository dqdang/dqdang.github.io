title: xv6 container system
category: posts

A container system for the MITâ€™s OS xv6. Using file, process, and resource isolation, the tool allows
users to create containers running on virtual consoles.

First thing's first, this project had a ton of interesting commits, ranging from "**** this project" to "Update". It's quite nostalgic actually. I wonder if the mess of commits ever threw people off... because it definitely did for us.

Aside from the descriptive messages, this was one of my first projects reading a large code base and adding a core functionality. Here are some of my thoughts on the project:

  **1)** Multiple design changes had to be made to support file isolation. Each feature prior to the changes triggered more red flags than my ex-girlfriend.

  **2)** Passing kernel entries became more of a hassle than initially thought, and creating user/kernel separation turned out to be more plumbing than development.

  **3)** Reading code is way more difficult than writing. The single worse mistake any sofware company can make is rewriting their code from scratch. I definitely have thought about that many times... Especially during this project.

Second off, I never realized the importance of not jumping into code before thinking ahead before. It's too didactic, so I won't bore you with details, but I did not plan well for this project at all. It always comes with a general idea plus a couple inspirations sprinkled here and there only to realize the brilliant inspiration is a huge design flaw, blocking the real issue underneath the bed sheets. By jumping in, I not only set back the project by a few important days, but also caused me to rip my hair out trying to make the inspiration work. Fast forward and it gets to another road block. Repeat and repeat and maybe [/r/SuicideWatch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/) is the subreddit you want to visit after those 6 hours of debugging to find out your design sucks. Unfortunately, it happens more often than usual, and it terrifies me that production code is enormous, and small hacks are constantly being added in, compounding on the problem and smothering the fundamental flaws in the code. But hey, don't fix it if it ain't broke. Don't want to make the single worse mistake a software company can make.
