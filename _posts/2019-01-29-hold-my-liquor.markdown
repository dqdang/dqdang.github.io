*A Facebook messenger bot providing a quick and easy way to get a random location for a meal*

How many times have you gotten upset at not being able to find food while chatting with your friend on messenger? For me, more than I would like to admit.

Having a bit of experience with the HPP stack now (Heroku, Python, PostgresSQL), I decided to add in another API in conjunction with Facebook's Messenger API: Yelp. It's usable for now, although Heroku's restriction with Dyno hours limits the bots' usage.

Take a look at the project if you want:
